	"description": "I love Mining Drones mod, but the original recipe looks too imbalanced: it requires nothing but raw iron! No need to place miners & belts almost for free, with even no electricity usage!\n\nThis mod fixes the balance by:\n1. Adding a technology needed to be researched before you can create mining drones and depot.\n2. Making the recipe harder yet customizable with startup settings: besides iron, gears and sticks, you can add steel, green/red/blue circuits, heat/electric engine, battery. Required technologies & science packs will be adjusted by your settings.\n\nSince now, creating mining drones feels like a desired reward! ^_^\n\nIf you're crazy, there are additional settings to disable Burner and/or Electrict Mining Drills.",
